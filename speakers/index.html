Omnipotent DSLs can be great, but sometimes we want to just write Ruby. We're going to look at the process of designing a new API for attributes and type casting in Rails 5.0, and why simpler is better. We'll unravel some of the mysteries behind the internals of Active Record. After all, Rails is ultimately just a large legacy code base.<br><br>In this talk you'll learn about the process of finding those simple APIs which are begging to be extracted. You'll learn the refactoring process that can be used to tease them out slowly. And you'll be getting a sneak peak at several of the features coming in Rails 5.0.</p></div></div></article><div class=u-paddingLarge></div><article class="SpeakerEntry u-paddingLarge"><div class=SpeakerEntry-basics><a href=/speakers#_ko1><div class=Speaker-pictureWrapper><img alt="" class=Speaker-picture src=/img/speakers/koichi.jpg></div><h1 class="Speaker-name Speaker-name--spaced"><div class=Speaker-firstName>Koichi</div><div class=Speaker-lastName>Sasada</div></h1></a><div class=Speaker-links><a aria-label="Koichi Sasada's twitter" target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/_ko1><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a aria-label="Koichi Sasada's github" target=_blank href=https://github.com/ko1><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></div></div><div class=SpeakerEntry-info><h2 class=Speaker-descTitle>Programmer, mainly developing Ruby interpreter (CRuby/MRI)</h2><p class=Speaker-info-text>Koichi Sasada is a programmer, mainly developing the Ruby interpreter (MRI).

We all want to use these ideas to ensure the long-term maintainability of our codebases. It is, however, often unclear what we should be defending against and what form those defenses should take. We can find places where defensive patterns could be added by looking at the edge cases that occur in our system. Where it seems appropriate, we can then apply ideas and patterns from defensive programming.<br><br>In this talk we'll look at some of the extremely defensive patterns that have been driven out in RSpec throughout the years. We'll look at building Ruby that works accross a wide range of interpreters and versions (including 1.8.7!). We'll investigate how you can write code that defends against objects that redefine methods like send, method and is_a?. We'll also see how the behaviour of prepend can occasionally confuse even the most mature source bases.<br><br>You should come to this talk if you want to learn about inheritence and method resolution in ruby, defensive programming techniques and cross interpreter Ruby patterns.</p></div></div></article><div class=u-paddingLarge></div><article class="SpeakerEntry u-paddingLarge"><div class=SpeakerEntry-basics><a href=/speakers#chrisweyer><div class=Speaker-pictureWrapper><img alt="" class=Speaker-picture src=/img/speakers/christian-weyer.jpg></div><h1 class="Speaker-name Speaker-name--spaced"><div class=Speaker-firstName>Christian</div><div class=Speaker-lastName>Weyer</div></h1></a><div class=Speaker-links><a aria-label="Christian Weyer's twitter" target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/chrisweyer><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a aria-label="Christian Weyer's github" target=_blank href=https://github.com/cweyer><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></div></div><div class=SpeakerEntry-info><h2 class=Speaker-descTitle>Developer, partner at Crispy Mountain, standby doctor, runner, mountainbiker</h2><p class=Speaker-info-text>Christian was born in 1985 in the Saarland region of Germany.

At the same time it’s often hard to see the exact moment when a simple refactoring would save a given class from taking the wrong turn, and real-life projects tend to have real-life sadlines with their tireless chants of ‘let’s refactor this in thenext sprint’.<br><br>Ruby’s dynamism means static code analysis is tricky (to say the least), but tools like RuboCop and reek bravely show it’s not impossible.

When presented with a new problem, a rubyist's first impulse is often searching for that gem. And yet, it is often the case that, for the sake of simplicity, we would be better not doing that. Why add another dependency without first checking whether the standard library already covers that. Because there are many overlooked pieces of the standard library that will be handy for us and solve our problems in a simple, dependency-free way.<br><br>This talk will cover 5 of them (since it is impossible to show them all).

You will learn how to avoid the most common pitfalls when changing the architecture of a complex codebase, how we took our first steps towards a service oriented architecture, and moved to continuous deployment.<br><br>This rewrite project was a transformative process, not only of our codebase, but of our culture. During this time, our company discovered that by working together in cross-functional teams we can be more productive and deliver better products.</p></div></div></article></div></section><section class="Scene Scene--footer"><div class=Scene-layers id=layers data-limit-x=10><div class="Scene-fullSize Scene-stars"></div><div class="Scene-cloudsWrapper Scene-clouds Scene-clouds--back"></div><div class="Scene-fullSize Scene-mountains"></div><div class="Scene-cloudsWrapper Scene-clouds Scene-clouds--front"></div><div class="Scene-fullSize Scene-topSkyline"></div></div><div id=SceneOverlay class=SceneOverlay><img class=SceneOverlay-smallLogo src=/img/logo-footer.png><div class=SceneOverlay-footerTitle>Rubyconf</div><div class=SceneOverlay-footerSubtitle>Portugal’15</div></div></section><script src=//use.typekit.net/nds5ogu.js></script><script>try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}</script><script type=text/javascript>!function(){var analytics=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!analytics.initialize)if(analytics.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{analytics.invoked=!0;analytics.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","group","track","ready","alias","page","once","off","on"];analytics.factory=function(t){return function(){var e=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);e.unshift(t);analytics.push(e);return analytics}};for(var t=0;t<analytics.methods.length;t++){var e=analytics.methods[t];analytics[e]=analytics.factory(e)}analytics.load=function(t){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript";e.async=!0;e.src=("https:"===document.location.protocol?"https://":"http://")+"cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/"+t+"/analytics.min.js";var n=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n)};analytics.SNIPPET_VERSION="3.0.1";
